progAss2.py: The original python script. No functions defined. Just run the file using python

************* Algorithm ************
1. split dataset
2. alpha = 0.4
3. Repeat until y_hat(n) != y(n) for all n OR iteration limit exceeds:
4. 		for n = 1, ..., N:
5. 			if sign of inner product of nth datapoint and weight vector is not equal to label:
6.				w <---- W + alpha * nth datapoint * nth label
7. Check accuracy on test dataset

************* Results **************
Since the dataset was split by random sample, the 
average accuracy varies in each run. Typically it is
close to 0.88

************* Interpretations *****
None
